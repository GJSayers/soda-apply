                    Whilst SODA Apply strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all 
                    areas of the website.

                <p>
                    We are continually seeking out solutions that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall web accessibility. In the meantime should
